# Emotion Recognition System

## Overview
The Emotion Recognition System is a project designed to detect human emotions from facial images and audio signals. By leveraging advanced image processing and audio analysis techniques, this system aims to provide accurate emotion detection for various applications, including mental health monitoring, user experience enhancement, and interactive systems.
